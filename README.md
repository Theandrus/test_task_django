# test_task_django
A little project on Django

First of all, i have installed all libraries, which i need. Secondly, i create app doctors and adm(django-admin  startproject <doctors>, django-admin  startproject <adm>
Then i create dockerfile, Docker-compose and requirements.txt files. Then i've started to create models. After that i've made some changes in settings.
Then i make migrations in the terminal ( to create database models(Category and Doctor) ).

API's:
  main/ - main page on the site;  
      administration/ - admin page, on which you can add, change, categories and doctors
